## Objectives

Message-Oriented Middleware is among the most popular technologies used for connecting
applications. The best practices in implementing messaging systems in enterprise application
integration refer to applying enterprise integration patterns (EIP).

Your task is to read [Chapter 3: Messaging Systems](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/docs/EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns_HohpeWoolf_ch03.pdf) and create a glossary of at least ten terms, related to System Integration, which you find essential.
